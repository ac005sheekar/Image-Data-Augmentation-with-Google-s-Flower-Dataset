# Image-Data-Augmentation-with-Google-s-Flower-Dataset
Pip commands for the installation of the libraries and packages needed to train and test the model with proper data augmentation functions.

(For Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab)

Tensorflow-GPU:                      !pip install tensorflow-gpu (Only for Jupyter. In Colab, just select the runtime environment as "GPU".)

Tensorflow:                          !pip install tensorflow

Keras:                               !pip install keras

OpenCV:                              !pip install opencv-python

Python Image Library (PIL):          !pip install pillow



For Pycharm IDE / Visual Studio:

Tensorflow-GPU:                      pip install tensorflow-gpu

Tensorflow:                          pip install tensorflow

Keras:                               pip install keras

OpenCV:                              pip install opencv-python

Python Image Library (PIL):          pip install pillow
